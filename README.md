Talktorials from 1-8 still have some unsolved questions:
1. For unwanted structures, we just take PAINS as example, but it is also possible to use an external list and get structure matches manually. If we have time, additional literature work.

2. For decide whether a molecule is active or inactive, we take pIC50 cutoff value, but this value for our target MCL1 hasn't make sure, for now I use value of 6.3
A: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821002392
pIC50:5.92

3. For Talktorial 8, in the line of choosing resolution PDB entries, allosteric and orthosteric ligands for MCL1 need to get from literature
A: Can't find relavant literature, so didn't distinguish allosteric and orthosteric ligands

4. For Talktorial 9, in the process of setting static parameters for k-means clustering 'kq = 7', this value can from further literature researching

5. In the output image, some images are not available, not sure if it is because my computer.
